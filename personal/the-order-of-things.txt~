'personal/' is set up like so:
  comp-domain/comp-name
  comp-domain/comp2-name
  other-domain/other-comp-name
  ...
  emacs.el

In each computer's folder are three files:
  after.el
  before.el
  comp-name.emacs

comp-name.emacs is that computer's .emacs file. It should be symlinked or copied to the proper location.

The .emacs should call bootstrap.el's bootstrap-init function, which will run the following files in this order:
    before.el
    emacs.el
    after.el
